# noise-machine 
**noise-machine** is an audio tool for experimentation. 
It takes two files, cuts them in random order, and mash-ups together. 
What makes the sound unique is that we download the output file to buffer two times, and its sound becomes worse and stranger, as we like!!!
### How to setup
First, clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/PrabhuUdurg/noise-machine.git
```
Next, enter the folder of repo and src. After, run the build script to be sure that you have all dependencies:
```
./build.sh
```
Finally, run noise file with such arguments: 
```
./noise path/to/input1.wav path/to/input1.wav output.wav
```
NOISE MACHINE CAN SUPPORT JUST WAV OR MP3 FORMATS.
